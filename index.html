          <h2><strong>CIMS - Cidnay International Masterclass Series ®</strong></h2>
          <p class="lead"><strong>Festival & Academy</strong></p>
          <h4><strong>_____</strong></h4>
          <p class="lead"></p>

          <p align="justify">CIMS – Cidnay International Masterclass Series, Festival & Academy, is an event that promotes musical excellence, of an international character, and inspires the community and younger generations through Art.</p>
          <p align="justify">CIMS affirms a holistic vision, providing players and listeners with undeniable moments of musical subtlety, accompanied by time for relaxation and meditation, time to visit local cultural and environmental heritage, and time for sharing and debate, relating music with architecture, with sculpture - with the arts; with the life of the community, from different spatial and chronological contexts.</p>
          <p align="justify">Thus, CIMS has as core concept the CONTACT. Contact between musicians, artists, between teacher and students, between participants of different latitudes, with other expressions and artistic languages, with fields of knowledge and experiences complementary to music, with a variety of audiences, partners, between presential and digital. This way, we fulfill the purpose of offering an inspiring program, rich in content, and that positions itself as an obligatory stop-off point for the most talented musicians.</p>
          <p align="justify">Held in a city bathed by the Ave river, CIMS' Academy inspires young musicians through contact with a deep mark of the Baroque architecture, São Bento Monastery. In addition, Santo Tirso is, today, one of the European capitals of contemporary sculpture, with artworks distributed around the city, in spaces of enjoyment, such as squares, gardens and parks. The architectural work of Álvaro Siza Vieira and Eduardo Souto de Moura, Pritzker Prizes, can also be admired, particularly the MIEC, Museu Internacional da Escultura Contemporânea (International Museum of Contemporary Sculpture).</p>

          <img src="img/carlosvilela4.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="">
          <p class="lead"><small>&copy; Carlos Vilela</small></p>

          <p align="justify">It is within this context, of contact between historical and artistic periods, that fit the spaces where the Academy masterclasses and rehearsals are held, with openness to the local community. Fábrica de Santo Thyrso, Centro de Arte Alberto Carneiro and Quinta de Fora are spaces with privileged views, close to the river and, the last one, property of an Agricultural School.</p>
          <p align="justify">The main accommodation facility for musicians is also a privileged space, a charming unit, Cidnay Santo Tirso – Charming Hotel & Executive Center. <a href="https://www.hotel-cidnay.pt/" target="_blank">➥ more</a></p>
          <p align="justify">Finally, CIMS assumes a vocation of social responsibility, by establishing a partnership with a reference entity, in Portugal, in the childcare for children suffering abuse, to provide, within the program, awareness building amongst the younger generations to the importance of music in their recovery for life.</p>
          <p align="justify">CIMS stands in the national and international panorama of the events of artistic and cultural valorization, with a regular character.</p>

          <h4><strong>_____</strong></h4>
          <p class="lead"></p>
          <img src="img/maisky_cims23.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="">
          <p class="lead"></p>
          <h3>Mischa Maisky - Guest Professor</h3>
          <p class="lead"></p>
          <p align="justify">Mischa Maisky has the distinction of being the only cellist in the world to have studied with both Mstislav Rostropovich and Gregor Piatigorsky. Rostropovich lauded Maisky as &quot;... one of the most outstanding talents of the younger generation of cellists. His playing combines poetry and exquisite delicacy with great temperament and brilliant technique.&quot;</p>
          <p align="justify">Born in Latvia, educated in Russia and later repatriated to Israel; Maisky has been enthusiastically received in London, Paris, Berlin, Vienna, New York, Tokyo and many other major music centres.</p>
          <p align="justify">He considers himself a citizen of the world: “I’m playing an Italian cello, with French and German bows and Austrian and German strings, my 6 children were born in 4 different countries, my wife is half Sri Lankan-half Italian, I’m driving a Japanese and an American electric car, I wear an Indian necklace and a Swiss watch, and I feel at home everywhere where people appreciate and enjoy classical music.”</p>
          <p align="justify">Truly a world-class musician and a regular guest at most major International Festivals, he has collaborated with such conductors as Leonard Bernstein, Carlo Maria Giulini, Lorin Maazel, Zubin Mehta, Riccardo Muti, Giuseppe Sinopoli, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Daniel Barenboim, James Levine, Charles Dutoit, Yuri Temirkanov, Mariss Jansons, Valery Gergiev, Kirill Petrenko, Paavo Järvi and Gustavo Dudamel.</p>
          <p align="justify">His musician partnerships have included artists such as Martha Argerich, Radu Lupu, Nelson Freire, Evgeny Kissin, Itzhak Perlman, Lang Lang, Peter Serkin, Gidon Kremer, Yuri Bashmet, Vadim Repin, Maxim Vengerov, Joshua Bell, Julian Rachlin and Janine Jansen to name just a few.</p>
          <p align="justify">One of the highlights of his career was the year 2000. It was mainly devoted to a world-wide Bach tour of over 100 concerts! An expression of his deep admiration for this great composer is that Maisky has recorded Bach&#39;s Solo Suites three times, with his Cello Suite No. 1 being viewed more than 45 million times on YouTube.</p>
          <p align="justify">As an exclusive Deutsche Grammophon artist for more than 30 years he made over 35 recordings with such orchestras as the Vienna, Berlin and Israel Philharmonics, the London Symphony, L‘Orchestre de Paris, Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, Chamber Orchestra of Europe and others.</p>
          <p align="justify">In 2018, the very personal album ‘Adagietto’ was released with his pianist daughter Lily, and featuring bonus live recordings with Martha Argerich, Janine Jansen, Julian Rachlin and his violinist son Sascha. Included is a multi-track arrangement of Mahler’s Adagietto from his 5th Symphony with Maisky playing all parts (except the harp), a project the cellist had dreamed of for many years.</p>
          <p align="justify">His latest recording is entitled ‘20 th Century Classics’ and includes a Bonus CD of the world premiere of Benjamin Yusupov’s cello concerto (dedicated to Maisky) as well as a multi-track recording of ‘Bachianas Brasileiras’ by Heitor Villa Lobos.</p>
          <p align="justify">In June 2021, DG released a set of complete recordings with over 40 CDs.</p>
          <p align="justify">Maisky’s recordings have enjoyed world-wide critical acclaim and have been awarded the prestigious Record Academy Prize in Tokyo five times and the Echo Deutscher Schallplattenpreis three times, as well as the Grand Prix du Disque in Paris and the Diapason d’Or of the Year, as well as receiving several coveted Grammy nominations.</p>
          <p align="justify">His long and illustrious career has brought Maisky many honors and awards, just some of which include:</p>
          <p align="justify">In 2018, as Maisky was awarded the 46th Istanbul Music Festival Lifetime Achievement Award, he was lauded as ‘one of the greatest living cellists of our time’ for his ‘profound artistry and devotion to music’.</p>
          <p align="justify">In 2019, he was awarded Honorary Membership of the Royal Academy of Music. This honor is limited to 300 living persons at a time, recognising Maisky alongside such greats as Mendelssohn, Liszt, Stravinsky and Casals.</p>
          <p align="justify">In 2021, Maisky was appointed Honorary Academician of the Accademia di Santa Cecilia; founded in 1585, one of the oldest and most prestigious musical institutions in the world. The title of ‘Accademico Onorario’ is awarded to “the most outstanding foreign musicians and musicologists” and Maisky is only the second cellist ever to receive it.</p>
          <p align="justify">In June 2021, Maisky received the Honorary Fellow Award of the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance.</p>

          <h3>Lily Maisky - Guest Professor</h3>
          <p class="lead"></p>
          <p align="justify">Lily Maisky was born in Paris, moving to Brussels soon after. She began playing the piano at the age of four, with Lyl Tiempo, also studying with Hagit Kerbel, Ilana Davids and Alan Weiss. Lily was a pupil at the “Purcell School of Music” from 2001 till 2005 where she also studied jazz piano. She has received master classes and musical advice from renowned artists including Martha Argerich, Dmitri Bashkirov, Joseph Kalichstein, Pavel Gililov and Vitalij Margulis, to name a few.</p>
          <p align="justify">Concert appearances have taken her throughout Europe and she regularly tours the Far East, North and South America.

          <p class="lead"><i><strong>at CIMS' core</strong></i></p>
          <h4><strong>_____</strong></h4>
          <p class="lead"></p>

          <p align="justify">Santo Tirso is a city located 24 km from Porto and Guimarães. The nearest airport is less than 20 km away and there are good railway and road connections available. Still from a geographic point of view, this city is located in a point of transition between the Atlantic coast and the inland part of the north of the country.</p>

          <!--img src="img/carlosvilela1.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="">
          <p class="lead"><small>&copy; Carlos Vilela</small></p-->

          <p align="justify">The historical origins are related with the existing monastery, founded (or rebuilt), during the 10th century, by the Benedictine monks. Santo Tirso has held the title of county seat since 1834, keeping a current population of about 70,000 inhabitants. Economically, the textile and clothing industries are well implanted in this region. In terms of areas of interest worth being mentioned, we cannot ignore the Ave river and the countless waterfalls, as well as natural parks and forests, thermal baths, and tourism farms. Additionally, you can also find Romanesque and Baroque monuments, local handicrafts, attend popular festivals and taste the local gastronomy and wines as well as the conventual sweets.</p>
          <p align="justify">San Rosendo, who spent the last part of his life as a bishop in the already notorious cathedral of Santiago de Compostela (968-977), and was the founder of the Monastery of San Salvador de Celanova, which stimulated culture and the development of Christian kingdoms at the threshold of the year thousand, was born in the territory of Santo Tirso, in the current parish of São Miguel do Couto.</p>

          <img src="img/carlosvilela3.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="">
          <p class="lead"><small>&copy; Carlos Vilela</small></p>

          <p align="justify">The quality of life in Santo Tirso is undeniably good and this idea is reinforced by the substantial cultural offer available. Amongst the existing cultural organizations, we can highlight MIEC - International Museum of Contemporary Sculpture (<a href="http://miec.cm-stirso.pt/en/" target="_blank">➥ more</a>), Alberto Carneiro Art Center, the Municipal Museum Abade Pedrosa (with a vast archaeological collection), the Municipal Historical Archive, the Municipal Library, the Interpretative Center of the Monte Padrão (Archaeological Station), ARTAVE - Artistic Professional School and countless other schools. In addiction, there are also spaces of exhibition and enjoyment, such as the Fábrica de Santo Thyrso and its Nave Cultural, or the Vila das Aves Cultural Center, together with sporting facilities and nature related activities.</p>
          <p align="justify">Santo Tirso can also be proud of having a living heritage of musical ensembles, folklore and theater groups, dance academies, numerous local cultural spaces and festivities. There are several plastic artists who were born or currently reside in this city, amongst whom we name Tomaz Pelayo and José Cavadas, in addition to a vast group of great photographers. On this website, you can take a look at some beautiful shots by Carlos Vilela.</p>
          <p align="justify">Santo Tirso hosts, annually, an International Guitar Festival, an International Organ Festival and regular International Cello Masterclasses, promoted by the Franz Schubert Foundation.</p>
